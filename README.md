## Coding Task

After successfully launching the Docker container, a default admin account will be created. This account allows you to perform various administrative tasks. It's important to note that most routes in the application are protected. Therefore, you must supply an authentication token when accessing each protected route.

**Default Admin Account Credentials:**

- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: Admin123#
